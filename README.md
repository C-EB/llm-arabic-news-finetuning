# 📰 Arabic News Fine-Tuning with Qwen LLM

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the **fine-tuning of a pre-trained Qwen large language model (LLM)** on **Arabic news data**, leveraging modern NLP tooling and scalable inference solutions. The primary objective is to **adapt a multilingual LLM** for **Arabic-specific tasks** such as news understanding, entity extraction, and summarization.

---

## 🎯 Goal

* Customize a base LLM (Qwen) for **Arabic news comprehension** using **supervised fine-tuning (SFT)**.
* Evaluate its ability to handle **downstream tasks** in Arabic (NER, translation).
* Optimize and deploy the model for **fast inference using vLLM**.
* Offer an **educational guide** and practical workflow for parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA).
