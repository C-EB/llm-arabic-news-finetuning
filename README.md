# Arabic News Fine-Tuning with Qwen LLM

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the **fine-tuning of a pre-trained Qwen large language model (LLM)** on **Arabic news data**, leveraging modern NLP tooling and scalable inference solutions. The primary objective is to **adapt a multilingual LLM** for **Arabic-specific tasks** such as news understanding, entity extraction, and summarization.

---

## Goal

* Customize a base LLM (Qwen) for **Arabic news comprehension** using **supervised fine-tuning (SFT)**.
* Evaluate its ability to handle **downstream tasks** in Arabic (NER, translation).
* Optimize and deploy the model for **fast inference using vLLM**.
* Offer an **educational guide** and practical workflow for parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA).

## Workflow Summary

### 1. Environment Setup

* Installation of required libraries via `pip`.
* Hugging Face, LLaMA-Factory, and vLLM configuration.

### 2. Data Preparation

* Dataset converted to structured JSON using **Pydantic** models.
* Format: Instruction-style prompts with input-output pairs.

### 3. Model Fine-Tuning (SFT)

* Based on **Qwen** LLM with LoRA adapters for efficient training.
* Configured and launched with `LLaMA-Factory`.
* Tracked on **WandB** for monitoring.

### 4. Evaluation

* Custom prompts used to validate capabilities:

  * Summarization
  * Named Entity Recognition
  * Translation

### 5. Inference with vLLM

* Model served with **vLLM** for ultra-fast inference.
* Cost-effective token usage validated.

### 6. Token Cost Estimation

* Calculated expected cost of using the fine-tuned model per 1K tokens.
